    <para id="import-auto-id7112289"><emphasis effect="bold">Rationale:  </emphasis>Teachers who are beginning, accomplishing, and completing their journeys toward tenure need guidelines for the full range of expectations a Jesuit school has; they need the opportunity to reflect on the success of each yearly journey; and they need to hear from school leaders on their view of those journeys.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id1169779381619"><emphasis effect="bold">Leadership:  </emphasis>This program was developed under the leadership of the Principal, Bob Gomprecht in consultation with the Assistant Principal for Professional Development and Supervision, Dennis Ahern; and the Assistant Principal for Academics and Student Life, Theresa Napoli.

The program itself, though, needs no location space, but it is often referred to in, and strongly supported by, the once-a-(6-day) cycle meeting program which is participated in by all non-tenured teachers, the principal, both assistant principals, and a veteran teacher.  That meeting takes place in the Library Seminar Room.<emphasis effect="bold"/></para>
    <para id="import-auto-id1169780783204"><emphasis effect="bold">Accountability/Assessment:  </emphasis>The effectiveness of the program is assessed by the reading of the portfolios which are turned in at the end of May.
