    <para id="import-auto-id1168210850187"><emphasis effect="bold">Program Description:</emphasis>At the beginning of every school year, every teacher participates in the Professional Growth Plan process.  The process is modeled after the IPP in that each teacher sets the context by describing how their previous year went, goes through the experience of reflecting on potential areas of focus or growth for the year ahead in the areas of the Grad at Grad, and writes some action goals for the year.  Teachers have a conversation with their Department Chair about their goals (which sometimes leads to revision), and then these goals are forwarded to the supervising Assistant Principal.  At the end of the year, teachers do a self-evaluation of their progress toward their goals and discuss this either with their Department Chair or (every other year) as part of a more extensive summative evaluation process with their Assistant Principal.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id1168210945204"><emphasis effect="bold">Rationale:  </emphasis>The PGP program was developed to facilitate regular reflection modeled on the IPP and viewed through the lens of the Grad at Grad.  It aims to help teachers be reflective practitioners in collaboration with their Chairs and Assistant Principals.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id1168214678448"><emphasis effect="bold">Leadership:  </emphasis>The process is really driven by the individual teacherâ€”both in the setting of goals and in their self-evaluation.  Oversight is provided by the Principal, Assistant Principals, and Department Chairs.  </para>
