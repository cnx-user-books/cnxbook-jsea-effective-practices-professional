      <emphasis effect="bold">Our new faculty members participate in a three-day orientation in August before they being teaching.  Then, during the school year, they meet each cycle (about 20 times) with various members of the school community (Academic VP, VP for Mission and Identity, VP for Student Affairs, Guidance) to introduce them to different aspects of the school.  (All new faculty members have the same free period to make this work.)</emphasis>
